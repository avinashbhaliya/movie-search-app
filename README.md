 ## movie-search-app

 I have worked with the Fetch API and JSON format, using the OMDb API to fetch and display popular movies with their posters, titles, and plots. I also implemented a search feature to display movies based on searched titles. Through this, I became proficient in using the Fetch API to make asynchronous requests and fetch data from remote servers.
